Pythia: Remote Oracles for the Masses

Pythia is a set of RDMA-based remote side-channel attacks that allow an attacker on one client machine to learn how victims on other client machines access data a server exports as an in-memory data service. 

We reverse engineer the memory architecture of the most widely used RDMA NIC and use this knowledge to improve the efficiency of Pythia. 

We evaluated Pythia both in a laboratory and in a public cloud setting. Pythia is fast (57 us), accurate (97% accuracy), and can hide all its traces from the victim or the server.

For more information please check [Pythia Paper](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/sec19-tsai.pdf) appeared in *USENIX SEC '19*.

This version of Pythia has been tested for the following configuration:

1. Software
  * OS: CentOS 7.2 
  * RDMA drivers: MLNX_OFED_LINUX-4.3-1.0.1.0
2. Hardware
  * RNICs:
    * ConnectX-4 (InfiniBand)
3. Package (on CentOS7)
  * required packages: `memcached memcached-devel libmemcached libmemcached-devel numactl numactl-devel mbedtls mbedtls-devel glib2 glib2-devel `
  * add the following two lines to the end of /etc/security/limits.conf
    * `* soft memlock unlimited`
    * `* hard memlock unlimited`

## How To Run Pythia

### Prerequisites
1. Three machines connected via RDMA capable devices (server, victim, and attacker)

### S1: Setup MEMCACHED
Modify MEMCACHED_IP in rsec_base.h to server's IP

### S2: Setup setup.json
Modify setup.json to have correct device index and debug mode

### S3: Compile Pythia
make clean all

### S4: Run server
execute run_server.sh on server machine

### S5: Run client
execute run_client.sh on client machine

### S6: Run attacher
execute run_attacker.sh on attacker machine

It will show you the Pythia line in figure 7 in the paper.

### S7: CloudLab (optional)
in CloudLab, please change ibsetup.h to enable RoCE since CloudLab is using RoCE

CAUTION: cloudlab is using vlan for RoCE. Therefore, SGID is configured as 4. Please check https://community.mellanox.com/s/article/howto-configure-roce-on-connectx-4 for more details
